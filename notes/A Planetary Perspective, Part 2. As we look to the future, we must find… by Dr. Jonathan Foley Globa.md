As we look to the future, we must find ways for society to thrive while respecting Earth’s intrinsic limits and its physical and biological realities. We must develop a true planetary perspective, where our biggest problems come into clearer focus, and our new solutions emerge from the lessons nature can teach us.

>_“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” — Charles Dickens,_ A Tale of Two Cities

In order to avoid dangerous changes to the global environment we are going to have to rethink the way we do many things as a civilization.

This is a tall order, and it requires a fundamental shift in our thinking.

Why? For almost all of human history, we pursued now-outdated strategies. We used up local resources, polluted our surroundings, drove other species to extinction, inflicted war and aggression on our neighbors, and kept spreading out to new frontiers as needed. And, despite its brutality and ugliness, this strategy worked very well until now. Over time, the surviving human societies became wealthier, our overall population grew in number and power, and the planet mostly didn’t notice.

But that’s over now.

The strategies that got us here no longer work. In an [Empty World](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Herman_E._Daly), they served us well. But today we have a [Full World](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Herman_E._Daly), where **our actions are now hitting the planet’s intrinsic physical and biological limits**, and (realistically speaking) there is nowhere else for us to go.

We need to shift from Empty World to Full World approaches. We need to recognize the biological and physical realities of the planet, and find ways to thriving within them. If we don’t, we not only jeopardize the environmental systems we depend on, we risk our future health, safety, security, and prosperity. Ultimately, we risk civilization itself.

Science is telling us that human activities are running up against the biological and physical limits of the planet — especially in terms of things like available land, the condition of our soils, Earth’s water resources, the state of species and habitats around the planet, and the ability of our atmosphere and ocean to safely absorb greenhouse gas pollution.

That news can some to lead many to see the _scarcity_ of resources on our planet. But I think we also need to be reminded of the incredible _abundance_ of planet Earth, and the opportunity that affords us. First of all, our planet has an _incredible_ amount of energy coming from the sun to power all of life on Earth, as well as the circulation of our atmosphere and oceans, and nearly all of the chemical reactions happening across our planet. Surely we can live with that energy source as well. Moreover, Earth has abundant material resources — including all of the ingredients for life — as long as we learn to live within the natural flows of matter occurring across the planet.

In short, there is plenty of energy and material on this planet for our civilization, and the rest of nature, if we simply learn to live within the biological and physical realities of our world. And within this abundance, we humans can build a thriving civilization, alongside a vibrant and verdant natural world.

So we must now shift strategies as a species. We need to **replace overexploitation and pollution** with **sustainability**, and in an interconnected and interdependent world, we must **replace conflict, aggression, and war** with **cooperation and collaboration**. Our future depends on it.

Most of all, **we need to gain a _planetary_ perspective** in order for us to maintain a thriving civilization. In previous chapters of human history, strategies that only benefited your clan, your community, your city-state, or even your nation may have worked. But today, they are a recipe for disaster. We need to find ways to live together on this world, within the biological and physical limits of the planet, in a way that doesn’t compromise our global ecosystems, wipe out critical natural resources, and disrupt the Earth’s climate.

This requires a broader perspective, a change in our frame of mind. It requires that we start thinking, and acting, like a planetary civilization.

Like many people, I find a great deal of inspiration in the wonders of the natural world. I am constantly filled with awe at the spectacular riot of life around us, whether seen through the microscope, a simple walk in a park, an expedition to a wild frontier, or the shocking “[Overview Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect)” that one gets from seeing our living world from space.

I find it especially humbling to think about the world as a _whole_ _system_ — where atmosphere, ocean, land, and life collide, elegantly processing energy, water, and countless elements, creating beautiful new structures and networks, with spectacular diversity. I feel a deep affinity to the biosphere as a whole, even though we individual humans are just a tiny part of it — temporary assemblages of borrowed atoms and energy, living only an instant of geologic time.

Nearly everyone feels a flicker of this feeling called “Biophilia” — a deep connection to the life around us. Some feel it while walking through a quiet forest, teeming with life, or watching a pod of whales traveling offshore, or plopping through a tide pool with our kids, exploring all of the living creatures nestled in the rocks. Somehow, life speaks to us, reminding us of the deep kinship we have with the rest of creation.

At their core, our environmental challenges stem from too many people not understanding, or intentionally overlooking, the physical and biological systems governing this planet.

We have gotten _very_ good at ignoring nature’s laws, pretending that we are exempt from them. But we’re not, and that’s where our problems arise. Whether we’re causing climate change, degrading ecosystems, or using up our natural resources, environmental problems begin when we ignore the limits of our planet, and act as if they don’t apply to us. This is a dangerous combination of ignorance and arrogance.

To gain a true planetary perspective requires that we learn how the planet actually works, and start following its basic rules. And if we take the time to look, we can learn powerful lessons about how to live, and thrive, on this planet from the rest of life on Earth.

For example, we should consider the fact that the rest of **life is _powered by renewable energy_**. No other forms of life burn oil, coal, or natural gas. Instead, they use Earth’s already abundant renewable energy sources, especially the sun. Earth is “energetically open” to the sun, and receives 1,370 Watts of heat and light per square meter of sunlit space — something we call the “solar constant” — and that’s been enough energy for the planet to do _everything_ for billions of years. This energy fuels almost all of our planet’s life, of course, but it also fuels its climate, weather, ocean currents, chemical reactions, and water cycling. In fact, for all of Earth’s history, natural systems have lived on this “solar income”. And we can, too, if we put our minds to it. **Sunlight — and associated energy from wind, waves, and biomass — can provide all the energy we need. Ultimately, it has to.**

Also, the rest of **life on Earth doesn’t deplete its key resources**. Our planet is essentially a “materially closed” system: Other than the occasional meteorite, nothing much enters the planet, and nothing much leaves it either. That means there are only so many carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus atoms, water molecules, and so on, on the planet for us to work with. So natural systems have evolved to be very frugal with Earth’s resources, and have gotten very good at recycling nearly everything. For example, a single phosphorous atom — a necessary ingredient for life — can be recycled hundreds of times within a forest, before it’s gently deposited into Earth’s sediments, where geology will ultimately recycle it once again. (By comparison, we mine phosphorus from rocks, often causing enormous pollution from the mines, then spray it as a fertilizer on vast agricultural areas, where only a fraction of it is used — only once — and the rest washes off, polluting downstream rivers and lakes.) **We need to mimic nature’s frugality with resources**, and learn to live within the natural flows of nature, never using resources faster than they can be replenished.

Similarly, the rest of **life has almost _zero waste_**. The very idea of “waste” — something that leaves a living system that cannot be used, and may indeed to be damaging to the surrounding environment — is largely alien to the rest of life. Usually, what’s “waste” to one organism is quite often “food” for another. Nature knows how to “close the loop”, and turn one organism’s wastes into another’s resource. Unfortunately, we humans use many things only _once_ before they become waste or toxic pollution, disrupting the environment around us. (Think again of the phosphorus atom in a natural forest, versus one sprayed as fertilizer on a farmer’s field.) We humans **have to get much better at “closing the loop,” turning waste into a resource, and emulating Earth’s “circular economy”.** And whatever wastes we cannot avoid must be carefully managed, only released at a rate that can be gradually absorbed in the environment without causing harm. Unfortunately, today, we are still very far from doing this.

We should also remember that Earth’s natural **ecosystems build strength and resilience from their biological diversity**. Evolution has created a remarkable diversity of lifeforms, and countless strategies for obtaining food, surviving harsh conditions, avoiding danger, and successfully reproducing, passing genes onto the next generation. In other words, the diversity of life offers a myriad of different solutions to the same problem — whether it is gathering food, surviving a tough winter, or finding a mate. And where one solution fails, others might work instead. That’s smart: Diversity means that life as a whole has _resilience_. Sadly, humans seem to ignore this lesson. We tend to build monocultures, especially in agriculture, with only one solution to a problem; if that one fails, the whole system fails. **We need to realize that diversity is _essential_ to building strong, resilient, and enduring systems.**

Most of all, the natural world teaches us that **we should be less arrogant.** We still have so much to learn from the living world around us. It’s humbling, but we have to admit that nature does things that we cannot yet do ourselves. Even the simplest pond scum is able to run entirely on renewable energy, with nearly infinite recycling, with zero waste, with extraordinary diversity and resilience. In short, nature is _one hell of an engineer._

Sadly, we are still _far_ from following the lessons the natural world can teach us. We still use dirty fossil fuels, not renewable energy — leading to air pollution, climate change, sea level rise, ocean acidification, and other critical problems. We still recklessly extract raw materials from nature, far faster than they can be regenerated, so they inevitably run out. And our throw-away culture typically uses something only once, creating a dangerous waste product that is tossed into the environment.

Thankfully, some people are beginning to look to nature as a source of inspiration and solutions. And we can follow their lead. For example, keen observations of the natural world have led to the basic concept and innovations of [**biomimicry**](https://biomimicry.org/what-is-biomimicry/), which seeks to design products that emulate solutions already found in nature. Observations of nature have also spurred the development of agroecology and permaculture, which seek to design farms and agricultural systems that employ sustainable solutions found in nature.

We have also begun to more keenly recognize [**ecosystem goods and services**](https://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.300.aspx.pdf) and [**natural capital**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_capital) and how they support human wellbeing. We are only now learning the extent to which natural ecosystems provide essential ecosystem goods and services to humanity, even if they don’t show up in our stock markets or balance sheets. Whether by providing clean water, fresh air, pollinating insects, or protection from natural disasters, natural ecosystems are _extraordinarily_ valuable to society. We could not survive without them.

In short, we need to preserve the working ecosystems and natural capital of our planet as an investment for our future. And, we need to preserve as much of the world’s remaining species and biodiversity as possible to ensure the stability and functioning of those ecosystems and the service they give us.

As we develop our planetary perspective, we must look to nature for even more practical solutions for living sustainably on planet Earth. After all, if we just stop to look, and learn, **nature can teach us how to build extraordinary things, within the limits of Earth’s resources, with zero waste, with amazing resilience, all powered by the sun.**

The future of our planet, and the future wellbeing of our children, is on the table. So what are we going to do about it?

We have to rethink and reinvent the foundations of our society so that we can live in concert with the natural world, and ensure that our children can thrive. We must start to use our newly found planetary perspective to manage our planetary-scale civilization.

And we need to get moving, quickly. Hope is _not_ lost, but we do have to act with a sense of urgency. We have wasted too much time already.

If we don’t act, and act soon and with purpose, this will become a crisis. A crisis that could affect everything we care about — including our children’s health, safety, and security. The problems could grow so large that they will dominate everything in future decades, and leave future generations with a compromised future. It would quickly move from being an “_environmental_” problem, where trees and birds are at stake, to a _civilization_ problem, where our very future is.

This is a serious challenge, of course. But it’s _not_ all doom and gloom. I’m _convinced_ that we _can_ build a better world, a world where people and nature can thrive. And many of the ideas and tools we need are already here. We just need to look at the problems in a different way, through a different lens, and get to work.

It turns out that we live in the most interesting, amazing, and challenging moment in all of human history. We didn’t ask to be born into this time — the time of our species’ inflection point, but here we are, and we have to decide what to do with it.

Are we going to learn to live sustainably on this planet, or not?

Are we going to leave a better world for our children, so that they can live safe and healthy lives, or are we going to condemn them to a degraded and dangerous future?

Are we going to be the best version of ourselves, or not?

_This is our moment._ This is the time we’ve been given to decide what we are going to do with our lives, and our future.

So, what will you do?
