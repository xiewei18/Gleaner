[06\. June 2014]

I’ll be heading off to Stockholm in August to present a paper at [the 2nd International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Sustainability (ICT4S’2014)](http://2014.ict4s.org "ICT4S conference website"). The theme of the conference this year is “ICT and transformational change”, which got me thinking about how we think about change, and especially whether we equip students in computing with the right conceptual toolkit to think about change. I ended up writing a long critique of [Computational Thinking](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~CompThink/ "See for example the work at CMU on teaching computational thinking"), which has become popular lately as a way of describing what we teach in computing undergrad programs. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with computational thinking in small doses. But when an entire university program teaches nothing but computational thinking, we turn out generations of computing professionals who are ill-equipped to think about complex societal issues. This then makes them particularly vulnerable to [technological solutionism](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/05/the-internet-won-t-save-us-evgeny-morozov-s-stand-against-technology-solutionism.html "See for example, Evgeny Morozov's take on solutionism"). I hope the paper will provoke some interesting discussion!

Here’s the abstract for my paper ([click here for the full paper](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/papers/2014/Easterbrook-ICT4S-2014.pdf "Full paper, From Computational Thinking to Systems Thinking")):

> If information and communication technologies (ICT) are to bring about a transformational change to a sustainable society, then we need to transform our thinking. Computer professionals already have a conceptual toolkit for problem solving, sometimes known as computational thinking. However, computational thinking tends to see the world in terms a series of problems (or problem types) that have computational solutions (or solution types). Sustainability, on the other hand, demands a more systemic approach, to avoid technological solutionism, and to acknowledge that technology, human behaviour and environmental impacts are tightly inter-related. In this paper, I argue that systems thinking provides the necessary bridge from computational thinking to sustainability practice, as it provides a domain ontology for reasoning about sustainability, a conceptual basis for reasoning about transformational change, and a set of methods for critical thinking about the social and environmental impacts of technology. I end the paper with a set of suggestions for how to build these ideas into the undergraduate curriculum for computer and information sciences.
